            House is a genre of electronic dance music characterized by a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat and a
            typical tempo of 120-130 beats per minute as a re-emergence of 1970s disco.[11] It was created by DJs and
            music producers from Chicago's underground club culture and evolved slowly in the early/mid 1980s as DJs
            began altering disco songs to give them a more mechanical beat.[1] By early 1988, House became mainstream
            and supplanted the typical 80s music beat.[12] House was created and pioneered by DJs and producers in
            Chicago such as Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders, Chip E., Joe Smooth, Steve "Silk" Hurley,
            Farley "Jackmaster" Funk, Marshall Jefferson, Phuture, and others. House music initially expanded
            internationally, to London, then to other American cities, such as New York City, and ultimately a worldwide
            phenomenon.[13] House has a large influence on pop music, especially dance music. It was incorporated into
            works by major international artists including Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Pet
            Shop Boys, Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga, and also produced many mainstream hits such as "Pump Up the Jam" by
            Technotronic, "French Kiss" by Lil Louis, "Show Me Love" by Robin S., and "Push the Feeling On" by the
            Nightcrawlers. Many house DJs also did and continue to do remixes for pop artists. House music has remained
            popular on radio and in clubs while retaining a foothold on the underground scenes across the globe.

            used in house music Duration: 9 seconds.0:09 A house rhythm played on a Roland TR-909 drum machine,
            featuring a four-on-the-floor bass drum plus cymbal, claps, hi-hats and rimshots In its most typical form,
            the genre is characterized by repetitive 4/4 rhythms including bass drums, off-beat hi-hats, snare drums,
            claps, and/or snaps at a tempo of between 120 and 130 beats per minute (bpm); synthesizer riffs; deep
            basslines; and often, but not necessarily, sung, spoken or sampled vocals. In house, the bass drum is
            usually sounded on beats one, two, three, and four, and the snare drum, claps, or other higher-pitched
            percussion on beats two and four. The drum beats in house music are almost always provided by an electronic
            drum machine, often a Roland TR-808, TR-909,[14] or a TR-707. Claps, shakers, snare drum, or hi-hat sounds
            are used to add syncopation.[15] One of the signature rhythm riffs, especially in early Chicago house, is
            built on the clave pattern.[16] Congas and bongos may be added for an African sound, or metallic percussion
            for a Latin feel.[15] Sometimes, the drum sounds are "saturated" by boosting the gain to create a more
            aggressive edge.[15] One classic subgenre, acid house, is defined through the squelchy sounds created by the
            Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. House music could be produced on "cheap and consumer-friendly electronic
            equipment" and used sound gear, which made it easier for independent labels and DJs to create tracks.[17]
            The electronic drum machines and other gear used by house DJs and producers were formerly considered "too
            cheap-sounding" by "proper" musicians.[18] House music producers typically use sampled instruments, rather
            than bringing session musicians into a recording studio.[19] Even though a key element of house production
            is layering sounds, such as drum machine beats, samples, synth basslines, and so on, the overall
            "texture...is relatively sparse".[20] Unlike pop songs, which emphasize higher-pitched sounds like melody,
            in house music, the lower-pitched bass register is most important.[20] House tracks typically involve an
            intro, a chorus, various verse sections, a midsection, and a brief outro. Some tracks do not have a verse,
            taking a vocal part from the chorus and repeating the same cycle. House music tracks are often based on
            eight-bar sections which are repeated.[20] They are often built around bass-heavy loops or basslines
            produced by a synthesizer and/or around samples of disco, soul,[21] jazz-funk,[6] or funk[21] songs. DJs and
            producers creating a house track to be played in clubs may make a "seven or eight-minute 12-inch mix"; if
            the track is intended to be played on the radio, a "three-and-a-half-minute" radio edit is used.[22] House
            tracks build up slowly, by adding layers of sound and texture, and by increasing the volume.[20] House
            tracks may have vocals like a pop song, but some are "completely minimal instrumental music".[20] If a house
            track does have vocals, the vocal lines may also be simple "words or phrases" that are repeated.[20] Origins
            of the term "house" House music pioneers Alan King, Robert Williams and Derrick Carter One book from 2009
            states the name "house music" originated from a Chicago club called the Warehouse that was open from 1977 to
            1982.[23] Clubbers to the Warehouse were primarily black gay men,[24][25] who came to dance to music played
            by the club's resident DJ, Frankie Knuckles, who fans refer to as the "godfather of house". Frankie began
            the trend of splicing together different records when he found that the records he had were not long enough
            to satisfy his audience of dancers.[26] After the Warehouse closed in 1983, eventually the crowds went to
            Knuckles' new club, The Power House, later to be called The Power Plant,[23] and the club was renamed, yet
            again, into Music Box with Ron Hardy as the resident DJ.[27] The 1986 documentary, "House Music in Chicago",
            by filmmaker, Phil Ranstrom, captured opening night at The Power House, and stands as the only film or video
            to capture a young Frankie Knuckles in this early era, right after his departure from The
            Warehouse.[28][29][30][31] In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up the Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first
            time he heard the term "house music" was upon seeing "we play house music" on a sign in the window of a bar
            on Chicago's South Side. One of the people in the car joked, "you know that's the kind of music you play
            down at the Warehouse!"[32] In self-published statements, South-Side Chicago DJ Leonard "Remix" Rroy claimed
            he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one's
            home; in his case, it referred to his mother's soul and disco records, which he worked into his sets.[33]
            Chicago house artist Farley "Jackmaster" Funk was quoted as saying, "In 1982, I was DJing at a club called
            The Playground and there was this kid named Leonard 'Remix' Rroy who was a DJ at a rival club called The
            Rink. He came over to my club one night, and into the DJ booth and said to me, 'I've got the gimmick that's
            gonna take all the people out of your club and into mine â€“ it's called House music.' Now, where he got that
            name from or what made him think of it I don't know, so the answer lies with him."[34] Chicago artist Chip
            E.'s 1985 song "It's House" may also have helped to define this new form of electronic music.[35] However,
            Chip E. himself lends credence to the Knuckles association, claiming the name came from methods of labeling
            records at the Importes Etc. record store, where he worked in the early 1980s. Bins of music that DJ
            Knuckles played at the Warehouse nightclub were labelled "As Heard at the Warehouse" in the store, which was
            shortened to simply "House". Patrons later asked for new music for the bins, which Chip E. implies was a
            demand the shop tried to meet by stocking newer local club hits.[36] In a 1986 interview, when Rocky Jones,
            the club DJ who ran Chicago-based DJ International Records, was asked about the "house" moniker, he did not
            mention Importes Etc., Frankie Knuckles, or the Warehouse by name. However, he agreed that "house" was a
            regional catch-all term for dance music, and that it was once synonymous with older disco music before it
            became a way to refer to "new" dance music.[37] Larry Heard, a.k.a. "Mr. Fingers", claims that the term
            "house" came from DJs creating music in their house or at home using synthesizers and drum machines, such as
            the Roland TB-303,[38] Roland TR-808, and TR-909.[39] These synthesizers were used to create the acid house
            subgenre.[40] Juan Atkins, a pioneer of Detroit techno, claims the term "house" reflected the association of
            particular tracks with particular clubs and DJs, considered their "house" records.[41]
